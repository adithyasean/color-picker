# Color Picker App - Project Guide

Welcome to the **Color Picker** iOS App project! 

This guide is designed for anyone, regardless of their coding experience, to understand how this app works, how it was built, and how to run it.

## 📱 What is this App?

**Color Picker** (formerly Chroma Match) is a memory matching game built for iPhone. 

**The Goal:**
The player is presented with a grid of face-down cards. They must flip two cards at a time to find matching colors.
- **Match:** The cards stay face up, and you get points (+2).
- **Mismatch:** The cards flip back down, and you lose a point (-1).
- **Win:** Find all pairs to finish the game and save your high score!

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (How it's built)

This app is built using **Apple's latest technologies**:

*   **Language:** [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
    *   This is the modern programming language used for all Apple platforms. It's safe, fast, and readable.
*   **User Interface:** [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/)
    *   This is Apple's modern toolkit for building user interfaces. Instead of dragging boxes around visually, we describe the UI in code (e.g., "I want a vertical stack of buttons"), and the phone figures out how to render it perfectly on any screen size.
*   **Haptics:** `CoreHaptics` / `UIKit`
    *   We use the iPhone's vibration engine (Taptic Engine) to give physical feedback when you tap cards or make a match.

## 📂 Project Structure (Where things live)

If you open the project folder, here is what each file actually does in plain English:

### 1. The "Brains" & Logic
*   **`Card.swift`**: 
    *   This defines what a "Card" is. It knows its Color, whether it is Face Up, and if it is Matched.
*   **`ScoreManager.swift`**: 
    *   This is the scoreboard. It saves your High Scores to the phone's permanent storage (so they survive even if you close the app).

### 2. The User Interface (Screens)
*   **`ColorPickerApp.swift`**: 
    *   The "Main Entrance". This is the first file the app runs. It sets up the main window.
*   **`HomeView.swift`**: 
    *   The **Start Screen**. It shows the animated gradient background, the Title, and the "Play Game" / "High Scores" buttons.
*   **`GameView.swift`**: 
    *   The **Actual Game**. This file contains the logic for the grid of cards, flipping animations, scoring math, and haptic feedback. It's the biggest file because it handles the gameplay.
*   **`CardView.swift`**: 
    *   A small helper that draws **one single card**. It handles the 3D flip animation and drawing the question mark on the back or the color on the front.
*   **`HighScoresView.swift`**: 
    *   The **Leaderboard Screen**. It reads the saved scores from `ScoreManager` and displays them in a pretty list.

### 3. Assets (Images & Colors)
*   **`Assets.xcassets`**: 
    *   A folder containing the **App Icon**, custom colors, and any images used in the app.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

You need a Mac computer with **Xcode** installed (available for free from the Mac App Store).

1.  **Open the Project**:
    *   Double-click the file named `ColorPicker.xcodeproj`.
2.  **Select a Simulator**:
    *   At the very top center of the Xcode window, you'll see a device name (e.g., "iPhone 16 Pro" or "Any iOS Device"). Click it and choose a simulator (like "iPhone 15").
3.  **Press Play**:
    *   Click the **Triangle Play Button** ▶️ in the top, or press `Command + R` on your keyboard.
4.  **Wait**:
    *   Xcode will "Build" (compile) the code. A simulated iPhone will appear on your screen running the app!

## 🎨 Design & Features

We focused on a **Premium User Experience (UX)**:

*   **Glassmorphism**: We use translucent, blurry materials (like frosted glass) for buttons and backgrounds to make the app feel modern.
*   **Animations**:
    *   The Home Screen background slowly changes colors.
    *   Cards don't just switch; they *flip* in 3D space.
*   **Controls**:
    *   **Abort (X)**: Quit the game early.
    *   **Restart (Arrow)**: Reset the board.
    *   **Safety Checks**: If you try to quit mid-game, a popup asks "Are you sure?" so you don't lose progress.

## 📝 Glossary for Non-Coders

*   **Variable (`var`)**: A box where we store information that can change (like the current `score`).
*   **Function (`func`)**: A set of instructions packaged together. For example, `restartGame()` is a function that sets the score to 0 and shuffles the cards.
*   **View**: Anything visible on screen (a button, a text label, an image).
*   **State (`@State`)**: Special storage for UI. When a `@State` variable changes (like `score` goes from 0 to 2), the screen *automatically* redraws itself to show the new number. You don't have to tell it to update!
